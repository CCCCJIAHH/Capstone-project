This is the RPCA file. 
The program is done on Jupyternotebook using Python3.7

The "face extraction" is used to extract the face box in a picture. Please install MTCNN in your environment using " pip instaill mtcnn" 

In the "RPCA" file, there are two choice. First is the single image RPCA. It can be used to remove small artifacts like blotches. Second is the multi-image RPCA. It can be used in background extraction or removing large noise. You need to make sure the iamges are in the same size.
